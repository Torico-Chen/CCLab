                <p>
                    Stellar Ember likes to stay away from noisy and crowded places, and they often find habitats in
                    quiet corners of the universe. They travel through nebulae or hide on the surface of stars, trying
                    to scare passing travelers.

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>
                    Stellar Ember's appearance is like a sticky star, breathing life into it like fire. Its body is
                    composed of small, bright particles. At its core, nuclear fusion reactions occur continuously,
                    compressing hydrogen atoms into helium and releasing huge amounts of energy.

                What do we know so far about the creature?
            </p>
            <p>
                Stellar Ember was born in one of the oldest regions of the universe, in a burst of radiant energy as
                pressure and temperature rose within the primordial nebula and the first flashes of nuclear fusion were
                ignited.

                Stellar Ember is a lonely wanderer. It drifts among the stars, observing the revolutions and dance of
                the planets. Billions of years later, it arrives at a vibrant stellar nursery where new stars are just
                beginning to emerge. Fascinated by swirling colors and high-energy charged particles, Stellar Ember
                senses untapped creative potential. It began to dance in the clouds, its shimmering body compressing
                slightly, igniting the gas. Soon, the first STAR of the new generation was formed.

                Click the mouse to generate stars
                Press "s" to glow (Stars, Star Trails, Stellar Ember in angry mode)
                Hold down mouse to display star trails
                Press "space" to create a black hole at the mouse point：
                ——Stellar Ember goes into angry mode
                ——Stars sucked into black holes
