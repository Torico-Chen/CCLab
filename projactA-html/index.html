    <h1>The creature's scientific name: Stellar Ember</h1>

    <!-- bbb -->

    <img width="500px" src="image.png" alt="Creature">

    <h3>Discovered by (name of scientist)/in (time of discovery):</h3> Voyager from M34-4602151-B discovered in 2025

    <h3>Family:</h3> no sense of family

    <h3>Habitat:</h3> Stellar Ember likes to stay away from noisy and crowded places, and they often find habitats in
    quiet corners of the universe. They travel through nebulae or hide on the surface of stars, trying to scare passing
    travelers.

    <h3>Appearance:</h3> Stellar Ember's appearance is like a sticky star, breathing life into it like fire. Its body is
    composed
    of small, bright particles. At its core, nuclear fusion reactions occur continuously, compressing hydrogen atoms
    into helium and releasing huge amounts of energy. This core is Stellar Emberâ€™s lifeblood and its most vulnerable
    point.

    <h3>Main feature:</h3> Some predatory creatures will attack it, trying to harvest its huge energy, and there are
    also alien
    creatures trying to capture the ashes of the star, but Stellar Ember will only be captured by the black hole. When
    it approaches a black hole, it triggers a stress state and is torn into a series of fragments by the extremely
    strong gravitational force, forming an accretion disk. In the accretion disk, the stellar ember continues to
    accelerate, rotate, and heat, and eventually passes through the black hole's event horizon and is permanently
    trapped inside the black hole.

    <h3>What do we know about this creature so far?</h3>
    <p>Stellar Ember was born in one of the oldest regions of the universe, in a burst of radiant energy as pressure and
        temperature rose within the primordial nebula and the first flashes of nuclear fusion were ignited.

        Stellar Ember is a lonely wanderer. It drifts among the stars, observing the revolutions and dance of the
        planets.
        Billions of years later, it arrives at a vibrant stellar nursery where new stars are just beginning to emerge.
        Fascinated by swirling colors and high-energy charged particles, Stellar Ember senses untapped creative
        potential.
        It began to dance in the clouds, its shimmering body compressing slightly, igniting the gas. Soon, the first
        STAR of
        the new generation was formed.

        Since then, Stellar Ember has made it its life's work to inspire new life and creativity wherever it goes. It
        will
        look for developing star systems, galaxies in the midst of artistic upheavals, and even fledgling civilizations
        just
        discovering their cultural voice. Stellar Ember will nourish these emerging creative works with its graceful
        dance
        and soothing pulses of light, just as it nurtured the stars long ago.

    <h2>*I believe that people who encounter Stellar Ember will gain enlightenment and inspiration, and their minds will
        be
        closely connected with the power of the universe, bringing creativity and inner peace.</h2>

    <h3>How do we interact with this creature?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Clicking the mouse generates brilliant energy particles that slowly dim and die upon impact.
        </li>
        <li>Press and hold "W" to create a black hole. Stellar Ember will enter the stress state and move with the black
            hole</li>
        "mouse".
        <li>Click "space" to observe the flow of time (change the background), and hold "S" to display star trails.</li>
    </ul>
