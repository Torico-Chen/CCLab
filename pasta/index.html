              <h1>How to make pasta</h1>
              Fresh pasta dough itself is easy to make. If you happen to own a food processor, the dough can be
              ready in less than 5 minutes.
              The process of rolling out the noodles was also easier than I expected, especially once I got the hang of
              using my little pasta maker. I also enjoyed discovering which I liked best for different occasions,
              preferring "00" flour most of the time but occasionally mixing
              it with semolina for a heartier shape or sauce. More people love fresh pasta, though. It tastes so
              delicious, fresh, and has an unmistakable chewiness. It instantly kicks some of our favorite pasta recipes
              up a notch. Well, I mean...

              <h4>Well done! Pasta lover</h4>
              <p><img class="imgleft" src="images/pasta pepe.jpeg" width="120" height="120" alt="" />Place the flour
                mound on a large cutting board. Then use your fingers or a spoon to make a good-sized well in the middle
                of the flour mound (kind of like a volcano). Add the egg to the center of the well. Sprinkle the egg
                with salt and drizzle with olive oil. Using a fork, start whisking the egg. </p>
              <ul class="list">
                <li>1-Flour</li>
                <li>2-Eggs</li>
                <li>3-Oil</li>
                <li>4-Salt</li>

              </ul>

                Sprinkle the egg with salt and drizzle with olive oil. Using a fork, start whisking the egg. Then, once
                it's combined, begin gradually whisking some of the flour around into the egg mixture, adding more and
                more until the egg mixture is nice and thick. Using your hands, fold the remaining dough together until
                combined. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth and elastic, roll the dough
                into a ball, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and let the dough sit at room temperature.</p>

                know what to write. I'm so hungry, but I think the school cafeteria doesn't have pasta. But I have to
                wait another half an hour to order takeout. Pasta is one of the most delicious foods in the world. My
                friend sitting next to me doesn't like tomato flavor. I'm really worried... Anyway, enjoy!</p>
